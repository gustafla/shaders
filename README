Random shaders for esfragt, Shadertoy and other such tools.  
I hope this is all written by me, if not, please contact me at <luutifa@gmail.com> and I'll do my best to remove your stuff.  
No commented code, no quality, so please use just for ideas and reference instead of just copying :D

All code here is public domain, use it as you wish, I don't care.
